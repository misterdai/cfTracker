# CFTracker

## Project Discontinued

This project is **no long maintained** and has known issues with ColdFusion 9.0.2 (due to Adobe back-porting code from CF10 in a patch) and does not work fully with Railo or other CFML engines.

## Reasons for discontinuation

Various reasons caused me (David Boyer) to cease development of CFTracker:

* Difficulty in supporting / testing multiple CF Engines.
* Not using the project myself.
* Lack of free time to work on the project.
* Project hit roadblocks, due to discovering security issues with CFML engines. Halting development while waiting for all engines to resolve their issues was very promblematic.
  * Halted due to code being released could easily lead someone in the know to exploitable areas.
  * Some issues were not fixed to a level that would make me confortable to make a release.
  * Did not want to affect the CFML community by ruining cheaper hosting solutions.
* Lack of incentives:
  * Not using it myself.
  * Loss of interest in CFML.
  * No related avenues that would incentivise project development
  * Little to no involvement from the community or users.
